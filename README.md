Compito is a simple and easy to use project management application with support for Multiple orgs. Each org can have multiple projects in it. Users can be then given access to the org or the project by assigning them different roles.

Each project can have multiple boards to manages different parts of the project. Making it easy to maintain.

### Home Page

The home page gives you an overview of the tasks, and projects the user has access to. The user can see tasks that were recently created and the high priority tasks as well.

There are quick links to get to projects and boards from the home page.
